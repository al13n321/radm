	This paper dwells on solving real-world practical problems deducted to Shortest Path and Minimum Spanning Tree problems. For each problem the detailed analysis is given and the algorithms for solving it is described. The tolerance analysis is provided for some of the problems. Floyd-Warshall shortest path algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm for finding minimum spanning tree are widely used throughout this work.
