\section{Preface}

\paragraph{}
	This report was made by students of group 172m specialization ``Internet Data Analysis'':

\begin{itemize}
	\item Vyacheslav Alipov (BSc; Applied Mathematics and Informatics);
	\item Michael Kolupaev (BSc; Information Technologies);
	\item Alexander Kouprin (specialist; Information Technologies).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
	Algorithms for solving the described tasks were implemented in \verb!C++! using Microsoft Visual \verb!C++! 2010 Express and Xcode 4.2.1 IDEs. Source code is available upon request.

\paragraph{}
	The main aims of the present work are 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Study mathematical formulations and algorithms for solving Shortest Path (SP) and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problems. Dijkstra shortest path algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm for finding MST in particular.
	\item Deduce the stated real-world problems to the SPP and MSTP instances.
	\item Apply theoretical knowledge and tolerance analysis to solving particular instances of SP and MST problems.
	\item Develop practical skills of solving SP and MST problems by the means of computer software.
\end{itemize}
