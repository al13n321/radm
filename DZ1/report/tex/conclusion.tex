\section{Conclusion}
	\paragraph{}
	In this report:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We studied mathematical formulations and algorithms for solving Shortest Path (SP) and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problems.
	\item We deduced the stated real-world problems 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 of designing shortest, quickest and minimum cost routes with different kinds of requirement  to the SPP instances and applied Floyd-Warshall algorithm or its modifications for solving them.
	\item We deduced the stated real-world problems 2.1, 2.2 and 2.6 of designing minimum cost cable networks with different kinds of requirement  to the MSTP instances and applied Kruskal's algorithm or its modifications for solving them.
	\item We applied tolerance analysis to determine the sensitivity of the solutions of the MST and SP problems with respect to the weight of the edges.
	\item We developed practical skills of solving SP and MST problems by the means of computer software through implementation of the algorithms for solving the described problems.
\end{itemize}
