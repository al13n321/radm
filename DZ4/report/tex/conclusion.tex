\section{Conclusion}
	\paragraph{}
	In this report:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We studied mathematical formulations and algorithms for solving network routing problems.
	\item We deduced the stated real-world problems 6.1, 6.5 and 6.6 of designing minimum cost production plans and optimal traveling routes with different kinds of additional constraints and used dynamic programming and other algorithms for solving them.
	\item We developed practical skills of solving network routing problems by the means of computer software through implementation of the algorithms for solving the described problems.
\end{itemize}
