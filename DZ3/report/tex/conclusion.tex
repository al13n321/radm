\section{Conclusion}
	\paragraph{}
	In this report:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We studied mathematical formulations and algorithms for solving matching problems. (Hungarian algorithm in particular).
	\item We deduced the stated real-world problems 4.1, 4.3 and 4.5 of designing minimum cost customer service plan, optimal activities distribution plan and maximum profit tie-in sales scheme with different kinds of requirement to the Assignment Problem instances (minimum or maximum weighted matching in the complete bipartite graph) and used Hungarian algorithm or its modifications for solving them.
	\item We applied tolerance analysis to determine the sensitivity of the designed solutions with respect to the repairing time of a technician in service plan, to the preference level of employee in the subtasks distribution plan and to the sales increase estimates in tie-in sales planning.
	\item We developed practical skills of solving matching problems by the means of computer software through implementation of the algorithms for solving the described problems.
\end{itemize}
