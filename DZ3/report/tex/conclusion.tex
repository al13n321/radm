\section{Conclusion}
	\paragraph{}
	In this report:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We studied mathematical formulations and algorithms for solving maximum flow problems.
	\item We deduced the stated real-world problems 3.1, 3.2 and 3.6 of designing minimum cost transportation plans and optimal customs checkpoint locations with different kinds of requirement to the minimum cost maximum flow problem instances and used Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or its modifications for solving them.
	\item We applied tolerance analysis to determine the sensitivity of the designed solutions with respect to the cost of the edges.
	\item We developed practical skills of solving minimum cost maximum flow problems by the means of computer software through implementation of the algorithms for solving the described problems.
\end{itemize}
